Note: For learning purposes I have used student account on Azure [URL](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/offers/ms-azr-0144p/)

What is Azure Pipelines?

- Azure Pipelines automatically builds and tests code projects. It supports all major languages and project types and combines continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous testing to build, test, and deliver your code to any destination.



- I see normally there are CI/CD fundamentals for DevOps, but in Azure there is one more factor to include, which is continuous testing.


Use Azure Pipelines to support the following scenarios:

* Works with any language or platform
* Deploys to different types of targets at the same time
* Integrates with Azure deployments
* Builds on Windows, Linux, or Mac machines
* Integrates with GitHub
* Works with open-source projects
